**The Peopleâ€™s Systems Language**

---

## Preface

Crown is a multi-paradigm language that combines **readability** with **systems-level power**.  
Its mission: **make code approachable like English**, yet **compile down to efficient machine-native executables** using LLVM.  

This book is written to be *hands-on*. Each chapter gives:
- **Examples** (code you can run),
- **Explanations** (whatâ€™s happening),
- **Exercises + Solutions** (so you can self-learn).

    done
done
```

## Chapter 11 â€“ Errors & Messaging (New)

**Goals:** Keep programs running, surface issues clearly, and communicate with users, files, and processes.

### 11.1 Error Philosophy
- Runtime errors are **contained by the VM**â€”your script retains control.
- **Beginner-friendly defaults**: uninitialized names read as safe defaults (e.g., `0`, `""`) so first runs donâ€™t crash.
- Prefer **defensive programming**: validate inputs, use `match` with guards, and return sentinel values when needed.

### 11.2 Console Messages
```crown
say "Starting job"
say "progress=" + 42
say "done."
```

### 11.3 File Messages
```crown
make txt = read file "inbox.txt"
say "inbox len=" + length(txt)
write file "outbox.txt" with ("processed:\n" + txt)
```

### 11.4 Process Messages
```crown
spawn "echo Hello from Crown"
wait
```

### 11.5 Defensive Patterns
**Safe division**
```crown
do safe_div(a, b)
    if b == 0 then give { "ok": false, "err": "divide by zero" } done
    give { "ok": true, "val": a / b }
done

make r = safe_div(10, 0)
match r with
  case { "ok": true, "val": v }  say v
  case { "ok": false, "err": e } say "error: " + e
done
```

**Shape checks via match**
```crown
do greet(person)
    match person with
        case { "name": n } if n != ""  say "Hello, " + n
        default                        say "error: bad person record"
    done
done
```

**Warnings for defaults**
```crown
say x
if x == 0 then say "warning: x is default-initialized"
```

## Chapter 12 â€“ Memory Model & Resource Handling (New)

**Goals:** Write efficient code without manual memory hazards.

### 12.1 The High-Level Model
- Crownâ€™s runtime manages memory automatically for primitive values, arrays, and maps.
- You donâ€™t call `malloc/free`; focus on **value flow** and **lifetime by scope**.
- Large data structures are passed by reference under the hood; treat them as values from codeâ€™s perspective.

### 12.2 Practical Guidance
**Reuse buffers**
```crown
make acc = ""
foreach line in ["a","b","c"]
    set acc = acc + line + "\n"
done
say acc
```

**Avoid giant temporaries**
```crown
# Good: process per-chunk
foreach chunk in read file "big.txt"  # assume iterator provided by runtime
    say "len=" + length(chunk)
done
```

**Mutate in place when sensible**
```crown
make xs = [1,2,3,4]
loop from 0 to length(xs)-1
    set xs[i] = xs[i] * 2
done
say xs
```

### 12.3 Files, Handles, and Processes
- File reads/writes are **scoped ops**; the runtime closes file handles after the operation.
- `spawn` launches a process; `wait` ensures cleanup of process resources.

```crown
spawn "mytool --version"
wait
```

### 12.4 Common Pitfalls & Fixes
- **Holding on to giant strings**: stream instead; process in chunks.
- **Accidental quadratic concatenation**: build arrays then `join`, or pre-size if available.
- **Dangling state**: centralize state in one map and pass it to helpers; return updated state.

```crown
make state = { "count": 0 }

do step(state)
    set state["count"] = state["count"] + 1
    give state
done

set state = step(state)
say state["count"]
```

# Epilogue

With these chapters you now understand **how Crown reports errors**, **how to message users/files/processes**, and **how the runtime manages memory** so you can focus on **clarity + performance**.
