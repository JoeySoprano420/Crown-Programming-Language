**Crown Script — Programming Language Specification**

---

## Foreword

Crown Script is specified in this International Standard as a general-purpose and systems programming language designed to make advanced programming accessible to non-programmers while providing compilation, optimization, and execution models competitive with established system languages.

This Standard specifies the syntax, semantics, library, and execution model of Crown Script, along with requirements for conforming implementations.

# 1 Scope

This International Standard specifies the Crown Script language, including:

* lexical elements,
* grammar,
* static and dynamic semantics,
* runtime model,
* optimization requirements,
* abstract machine definition,
* AOT and JIT compilation requirements,
* foreign function interface.

---

# 2 Normative References

* ISO/IEC 9899 — Programming Language C
* ISO/IEC 14882 — Programming Language C++
* ECMA-262 — ECMAScript Language Specification
* ISO/IEC 23360 — POSIX

---

# 3 Terms, Definitions, and Conventions

* **shall**: requirement
* **should**: recommendation
* **may**: permission
* **implementation-defined**: dependent on implementation, must be documented
* **undefined behavior**: behavior for which this Standard imposes no requirements

---

# 4 Lexical Structure

## 4.1 Character Set

Crown Script source is encoded in UTF-8. Identifiers and string literals may include any Unicode scalar values.

## 4.2 Tokens

Tokens are formed from:

* identifiers
* keywords
* literals (numeric, string, boolean)
* operators
* separators

Whitespace and comments are ignored except as separators.

# 5 Grammar (EBNF)

```
program         ::= { statement }
```

                  | make_stmt
                  | assign_stmt
                  | funcdef

                  | match_stmt
                  | expr_stmt
```

### 5.3 Expressions

```
expression      ::= logic_or
logic_or        ::= logic_and { "or" logic_and }
logic_and       ::= equality { "and" equality }
equality        ::= comparison { ("==" | "!=") comparison }
comparison      ::= term { ("<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=") term }
term            ::= factor { ("+" | "-") factor }
factor          ::= unary { ("*" | "/" | "%") unary }
unary           ::= ("-" | "not") unary | primary
primary         ::= NUMBER
                  | STRING
                  | "true" | "false"
                  | IDENT [ call_args ] { "[" expression "]" }
                  | array_lit | map_lit
                  | "(" expression ")"
```

### 5.4 Function Definitions

```
funcdef         ::= "do" IDENT "(" [ param_list ] ")" block "done"
param_list      ::= IDENT { "," IDENT }
return_stmt     ::= "give" expression
```

### 5.5 Control Flow

```
if_stmt         ::= "if" expression "then" block [ "else" block ] "done"
loop_stmt       ::= "loop" "from" expression "to" expression [ "step" expression ] block "done"
while_stmt      ::= "while" expression block "done"
repeat_stmt     ::= "repeat" block "until" expression
foreach_stmt    ::= "foreach" IDENT "in" expression block "done"
switch_stmt     ::= "switch" expression { case_clause } [ default_clause ] "done"
case_clause     ::= "case" expression block
default_clause  ::= "default" block
match_stmt      ::= "match" expression "with" { match_case } [ default_clause ] "done"
match_case      ::= "case" pattern block
```

# 6 Declarations and Definitions

Variables are introduced using `make` and bound in global or local scope. Reassignment uses `give` or `set`.

---

# 7 Statements

Each statement corresponds to an AST node (Say, Make, Assign, If, Loop, etc.) as defined in §5.

---

# 8 Expressions

Binary and unary expressions are defined in §5.3. Operators obey precedence rules given in Annex B.

---

# 9 Functions

Functions are declared with `do` … `done`. They may return values using `give`. Tail calls must be optimized.

---

# 10 Control Flow

Control constructs are semantically defined as in §5.5.
Break and continue control loop execution. Repeat–until executes at least once.

---

# 11 Types and Values

* Number (64-bit signed int)
* String (UTF-8)
* Boolean (`true`/`false`)
* Array (ordered collection)
* Map (unordered key/value, string keys)
* Function

---

# 12 Pattern Matching

Patterns include constants, wildcards, arrays, maps, and nested destructuring. Guards (`if expr`) may be attached.

---

# 13 Standard Library

Minimal built-ins:

* `print`, `length`, `append`, `keys`, `values`, `jsonstring`

I/O:

* `read file "name"`, `write file "name" with expr`

System:

* `spawn`, `wait`

---

# 14 Execution Environment

## 14.1 Abstract Machine

Defines stack, heap, call frames, exception handling.

## 14.2 Compilation

Implementations shall support:

* Ahead-of-time (AOT) to native binaries
* Just-in-time (JIT) execution

Optimizations (see §15) are mandatory at `-O2` and higher.

---

# 15 Compiler and Optimizer Requirements

## 15.1 Peephole

Eliminate redundant loads/stores.

## 15.2 Tail Call

Eliminate stack growth in tail calls.

## 15.3 Loop Unrolling

Unroll small fixed-count loops.

## 15.4 Constant Folding

Evaluate constants at compile time.

## 15.5 Profile-Guided

Use runtime profile for branch reordering.

## 15.6 Code Compression

Reduce IR/binary size without semantic change.

## 15.7 Vectorization

Exploit SIMD units for array operations.

## 15.8 Dead Code Elimination

Remove unreachable code.

---

# 16 Conformance

## 16.1 Levels

* **Level A**: interpreter compliance
* **Level B**: AOT + baseline optimization
* **Level C**: full optimization suite, JIT backend
